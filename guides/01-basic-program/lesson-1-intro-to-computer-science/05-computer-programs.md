# :symbols: Computer programs

Computers operate under the control of a changeable program. What exactly does this mean?. Let's analyze the computer program definition and its relation with computers, code, software and hardware.

## What is a computer program?

A computer program is a detailed, step-by-step set of instructions telling a computer exactly what to do. If we change the program, then the computer performs a different sequence of actions, and hence, performs a different task. It is this flexibility that allows your PC to be at one moment a word processor, at the next moment a financial planner, and later on, an arcade game. The machine stays the same, but the program controlling the machine changes.

Every computer is just a machine for executing (carrying out) programs. There are many different kinds of computers.


# Computer programming

Computer programming is the process of writing or editing source code. Editing source code involves testing, analyzing, refining, and sometimes coordinating with other programmers on a jointly developed program. A person who practices this skill is referred to as a computer programmer, software developer, and sometimes coder.

The sometimes lengthy process of computer programming is usually referred to as software development. The term software engineering is becoming popular as the process is seen as an engineering discipline.

## Why Programming?

You may already have used software, perhaps for word processing or spreadsheets, to solve problems. As we mentioned before, a program is a set of step-by-step instructions that directs the computer to do the tasks you want it to do and produce the results you want.

There are at least three good reasons for learning programming:
Programming helps you understand computers. The computer is only a tool. If you learn how to write simple programs, you will gain more knowledge about how a computer works.
Writing a few simple programs increases your confidence level. Many people find great personal satisfaction in creating a set of instructions that solve a problem.

Learning programming lets you find out quickly whether you like programming and whether you have the analytical turn of mind programmers need.
