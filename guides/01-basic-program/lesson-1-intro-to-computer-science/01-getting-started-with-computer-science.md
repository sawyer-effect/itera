# :baby: Getting started with Computer Science

People have been using mechanical devices to aid calculation for thousands of years. The abacus "the first automatic computer" is the earliest known tool of computing.

We now think of computers as machines, but before the 1920’s the term “computer” denoted an occupation. Before jumping into Computer Science, let's start learning a bit of the history, the concepts and the different areas where CS is involved.

## Brief History

First in the historical record was the [abacus](http://history-computer.com/CalculatingTools/abacus.html), helping the ancient technorati gain an edge over trading partners still counting cows and amphorae by hand.

The oldest known complex computing device, called the [Antikythera](http://www.age-of-the-sage.org/archaeology/antikythera_mechanism.html) mechanism, dates back to 87 B.C; it’s surmised the Greeks used this gear-operated contraption (found in a shipwreck in the Aegean Sea early in the 20th century, though its significance wasn’t realized until 2006) to calculate astronomical positions and help them navigate through the seas.

Computing took another leap in 1843, when English mathematician [Ada Lovelace](http://www.biography.com/people/ada-lovelace-20825323) wrote the first computer algorithm, in collaboration with [Charles Babbage](http://www.cbi.umn.edu/about/babbage.html), who devised a theory of the first programmable computer.

The modern computing-machine era began with [Alan Turing’s](http://www.turing.org.uk/publications/dnb.html) conception of the Turing Machine, and [three Bell Labs](http://ethw.org/Bell_Labs) scientists invention of the transistor, which made modern-style computing possible, and landed them the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics.

For decades, computing technology was exclusive to the government and the military; later, academic institutions came online, and [Steve Wozniak](http://www.woz.org/about) built the circuit board for [Apple-1](http://applemuseum.bott.org/sections/computers/a1.html), making home computing practicable.

On the connectivity side, [Tim Berners-Lee](http://www.biographyonline.net/business/tim-berners-lee.html) created the [World Wide Web](http://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/), and [Marc Andreessen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen) built a browser, and that’s how we came to live in a world where our glasses can tell us what we’re looking at.

With wearable computers, embeddable chips, smart appliances, and other advances in progress and on the horizon, the journey towards building smarter, faster and more capable computers is clearly just beginning.

## The Concept

Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems, it has been defined in terms of designing, analyzing, and evaluating algorithms.

Although knowing how to program is essential to the study of computer science, it is only one element of the field. Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms to solve programs and study the performance of computer hardware and software. The problems that computer scientists encounter range from the abstract-- determining what problems can be solved with computers and the complexity of the algorithms that solve them – to the tangible – designing applications that perform well on handheld devices, that are easy to use, and that uphold security measures.

Computer science is a discipline that spans theory and practice. It requires thinking both in abstract terms and in concrete terms. The practical side of computing can be seen everywhere. Nowadays, practically everyone is a computer user, and many people are even computer programmers. Getting computers to do what you want them to do requires intensive hands-on experience. But computer science can be seen on a higher level, as a science of problem solving. Computer scientists must be adept at modeling and analyzing problems. They must also be able to design solutions and verify that they are correct. Problem solving requires precision, creativity, and careful reasoning.

## Computer Science Areas

Computer science has a wide range of specialties. These include computer architecture, artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics and theory of computing.

## Computer Science is needed in every type of industry

This is the Digital Age. Computer programmers have all but infiltrated every aspect of our lives. Computer scientists theorize, design, develop, and apply the software and hardware for the programs we use day in day out.

Every industry uses computers so naturally computer scientists can work in any. Problems in science, engineering, health care, and so many other areas can be solved by computers. It's up to the computer scientist to figure out how, and design the software to apply the solution.
