# :beginner: What is code?

In computing, code is a term used for both the statements written in a particular programming language - the source code, and a term for the source code after it has been processed by a compiler and made ready to run in the computer - the object code .

## Definition

Code (also referred to as source, code or souce code) is the version of software as it is originally written (i.e., typed into a computer) by a human in plain text (i.e., human readable alphanumeric characters).

Source code can be written in any of the hundreds of programming languages that have been developed. For example: C, C++, Cobol, Fortran, Java, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby.

To be usable by a computer or other microprocessor-based product, source code must be compiled (i.e., translated by a computer) into machine language by a special program called a compiler. Also referred to as object code or binaries, machine language consists of a sequence of instructions (in the form of zeros and ones) that the processor can understand -- but which is very difficult for humans to read or modify.

## Uses For Source Code

Software is distributed (i.e., sold or given away) primarily in compiled form (i.e., binaries) rather than in source code form. There are good reasons for this, including the fact that it is usually much easier to install (particularly for ordinary users), it keeps the source code secret and the file sizes are much smaller (thereby speeding downloads from the Internet and conserving disk space).

Although its primary purpose is usually to generate ready-to-install binaries, source code has several other important uses as well, and thus there is often a demand for it along with, or even in place of, the precompiled versions of the software. The reasons for this relate to the fact that the source code is generally the most versatile, informative and permanent form of any software:

(1) System administrators and other experienced users frequently prefer to compile software themselves prior to installation because of the increased number of options and consequent greater control that it can provide in tailoring the software to particular requirements.

(2) It is relatively easy to fix bugs (i.e., errors), find viruses or other malicious content as well as to enhance or otherwise modify software using the source code, whereas it would be extremely difficult using the binaries.

(3) Having the source code version of software makes it practical to port the software to other platforms (i.e., develop versions for other processors and/or operating systems). Without the source for a particular piece of software, such porting is usually extremely difficult.

(4) Source code can be a valuable tool for learning, particularly for beginning programmers, who often find it helpful to study existing code to gain insight into programming techniques and methodology.

(5) Source code also serves as a communication tool between experienced programmers. This is because of its (at least ideally) concise and unambiguous nature. The sharing of source code between developers is frequently cited as a contributing factor to the refinement of their programming skills.

(6) Programmers often want source code because of their tendency to recycle parts of it into new projects, a practice referred to as software reusability.
