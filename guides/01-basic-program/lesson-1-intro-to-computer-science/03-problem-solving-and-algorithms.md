# :thought_balloon: Problem solving and algorithms

The computer is an important tool in computer science, but it is not itself the object of study. Since a computer can carry out any process that we can describe, the real question is: **What processes can we describe?**. Put another way, the fundamental question of computer science is simply: **What can be computed?**. Computer scientists use numerous techniques of investigation to answer this question. The three main ones are design, analysis, and experimentation.

As computer programers, when we are analyzing, designing and experimenting solutions there are two important techniques commonly used: problem solving and algorithms.

## Problem Solving

Problem solving consists of using generic or methods, in an orderly manner, for finding solutions to problems. Problem solving requires two distinct types of mental skill, analytical and creative.

Solving problems is the core of computer science. Programmers must first understand how a human solves a problem, then understand how to translate this "algorithm" into something a computer can do, and finally how to "write" the specific syntax (required by a computer) to get the job done. It is sometimes the case that a machine will solve a problem in a completely different way than a human.

Computer Programmers are problem solvers. There is not an specific framework or specific steps to resolve computing problems because the process can be different from one problem to other. However, the following phases are recommended:

* 1.- Understand the problem
* 2.- Make a plan of solution
* 3.- Carry out the plan
* 4.- Looking back i.e. verifying

## Algorithms

One way to demonstrate that a particular problem can be solved is to actually design a solution. That is, we develop a step-by-step process for achieving the desired result. We call this an **algorithm**. That’s a fancy word that basically means “recipe.”

_The design of algorithms is one of the most important facets of computer science._

One weakness of design is that it can only answer the question What is computable? in the positive. If I can devise an algorithm, then the problem is solvable. However, failing to find an algorithm does not mean that a problem is unsolvable, it may mean that I haven't hit upon the right idea yet. This is where analysis comes in.

Analysis is the process of examining algorithms and problems mathematically. Computer scientists have shown that some seemingly simple problems are not solvable by any algorithm. Other problems are intractable. The algorithms that solve these problems take too long or require too much memory to be of practical value.

_Analysis of algorithms is an important part of computer science_

Some problems are too complex or ill-defined to lend themselves to analysis. In such cases, computer scientists rely on experimentation; they actually implement systems and then study the resulting behavior. Even when theoretical analysis is done, experimentation is often needed in order to verify and refine the analysis. For most problems, the bottom line is whether a working, reliable system can be built. Often we require empirical testing of the system to determine that this bottom-line has been met. As you begin writing your own programs, you will get plenty of opportunities to observe your solutions in action.
